# Wordle Python Clone

This is my try to build a functional Wordle copy inside of Python.
Since I followed the Task step by step, here is a how to use:
1. User executes the Python File called "Exam.py".
2. User is prompted to start guessing the first word.
3. User is reprompted until guesses run out or user guesses correctly.
4. If the users guesses a word which shares letters with the word they are trying to guess, two hints are displayed:
A) What letters are matching and B) (if applicable) what letters match the exact positions.
5. After the above the user is asked whether they want to continue playing or not. 
6. If yes, it starts again with another word, having a maximum of three rounds. 
7. If not, the game terminates.

### Other important notes:

- The user may exit the game at any time by writing "exit"
- Random words are hardcoded, had no idea how to have them generated
- Have fun
